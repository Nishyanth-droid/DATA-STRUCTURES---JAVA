Space Complexity : 
------------------

1. The amount of memory the program needs to execute.
2. We don't use any metrics such as bits , bytes etc..to determine space complexity.
3. Instead we define it as amount of space required based on input size.

Different types of Space Complexity:
------------------------------------

1. Auxillary Space Complexity : 
--------------------------------

-> Auxillary space complexity is space consumed without considering the input values.

2.Space Complexity:
-------------------

-> Space Complexity is space consumed by including input variables.

Eg : public void printArray(int[] arr){
         int n = arr.length;
         for(int i = 0 ;i  <n ; i++){
             System.out.println(arr[i]);
         }
     }

    Auxillary Space Complexity = O(1)

    Space Compexity = O(n)  --> input array size of n

NOTE:
-----
We always calculate and consider Auxillary Space Complexity.
