Arrays : 
--------

1. A group of homogeneous elements with fixed size.
2. Memory location is continous in an array.
3. Indexing starts from "0" to "size -1".
 
Declaration:
-------------

Syntax : data_type variableName = new data_type[size] ;

Eg : int[] i = new int[5];

     //Each integer takes 4 bytes of memory.
     //Here we have created an array of size 5. So, in heap 4x5 = 20 bytes of     continous memory is created.  

     long[] l = new long[3];

     //Each long takes 8 bytes of memory.
     //Here we have created an array of size 5. So, in heap 8x5 = 40 bytes of     continous memory is created.
