Trees :
--------

-> Tree is a hierarchical data structure which is a collection of nodes where each and every node consists value and references of multiple child nodes.

Eg : Folder structures , Employee designations in an organisation

-> Trees can have heterogeneous data

-> Tree allows duplicates if required.

-> We can insert null / None values

-> Trees need not preservev the insertion order.

Common functionalities on Tree data structure :
-----------------------------------------------
1. insert
2. remove
3. traversals
   --> Breadth First Traversal
   --> Depth First Traversal
       i) Inorder traversal
       ii) Pre Order traversal 
       iii) Post Order traversal 

Terminologies of Tree Data structure :
--------------------------------------

1. Root Node
2. Subtree
3. Parent Node
4. Child Node
5. Leaf Node -> nodes without any child nodes
6. Level
7. Sibling -> Immediate child nodes of a same node
8. Descendant -> all the nodes that are in the below level from that particular node till the leaf nodes.
9. Ancestor -> all the nodes that are in the above level from that particular node till the root nodes.

Different types of trees:
-------------------------

Binary Tree:
------------
A tree in which each node can have at most 2 child(left,right).

Binary Search Tree:
-------------------
A Binary Tree in which each left subtree contains smaller values, right subtree contains greater values compared with root node value of the subtree.

Balanced Binary Tree:
---------------------
A Binary tree in which the height difference between the left sub tree and right sub tree is not more than 1.
